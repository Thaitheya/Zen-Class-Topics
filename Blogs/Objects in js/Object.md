### Objects and its internal representation in Javascript

 <span>**Object**<span> is the one of the most important JavaScript non-primitive <br>datatype. Object is the more important datatype which used familar in today's modern JavaScript. This is totally different with the primitive datatype such as Number, String,Boolean, null, undefined.


### Objects and properties
A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation: 

> objectName.propertyName


### Internal Representation of Objects
Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently. One common approach is using a hash table or a similar structure to store the objectâ€™s properties and their corresponding values. This allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.
